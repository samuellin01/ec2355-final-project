( Ourtel sent Fkft 590 , rptd Dept 503 , Bonn 233 , September 9 , 1951 and ourdes 243 , October 2 , 1951. ) Gerhart Eisler , East Germany\\'s propaganda chief , in his introduction , aid that his only regret was that there had been no West German repre- entative on the trade delegation which concluded this agreement . H. aid that he had no doubt that the Soviet Union Would be just as willing O conclude a similar long - term trade agreement with all of Germany as it ad been to conclude one with the GDR . Eisler further claimed that , \" the w trade agreement with the Soviet Union makes the GDR absolutely boycott- -oof \" . No figures were given as to the total amount of goods to be exchanged aring the years 1952-1955 covered by this agreement . The Bonn government as taken to task by Rau for having already backed down on certain importan ategories in the recently signed Interzonal Trade Agreement . He specif cally mentioned that West Germany could ls , wheat , meat , fats , wool , flax , tobacco , tea , and cotton . In return , East Germany is to deliver to the USSR industrial ● quipment , shines of all kinds , optical and fine mechanical products , chemicals , por- lain , glass , potash , motors , measurement and testing equipment , television ceivers , equipment for the food processing industry totalling 135 million Di A ships . Rau pointed out that such long - term trade agreements are only possible ween countries whose economies are developed according to a long - term onomic plan . He gave several examples to prove the friendly cooperation ween these two countries , according to which either one of them is willing change its production plans to help the other . For example , he pointed out at the Five - Year Plan foresaw the production of large boring and turning lls over 1600 millimeters in size . For the year 1952 the plan had called fo production of 28 of these machines of which three were to be exported . Hover , he continued , the requirements of the Soviet Union and of other tellite countries have forced the GDR to increase production plans for 1952 85 of such machines . In reciprocation , the Soviet Union , which had not inned to export to the GDR any ferrous alloys , has now agreed to do so be- use of the requirements of the GDR for the large quantities of alloyed Rau revealed that this trade agreement covers only the more importan ca to be exchanged between the two countries . Annual trade agreements be concluded covering less important items . The annual agreement for t C is to be completed in December 1951 , at the latest . Among the goods delivered by the USSR to the GDR under the four - year agreement are pig ling mill products , non - ferrous metals , ferrous alloys , coke , manganes ome ore , iron ore , technical oils and oil products , asbestos , apatite concentrates , large forgings , large dredges , other machines , basic ch . * , wheat , meat , fats , wool , flax , tobacco , tea , and cotton . Soviet Russia also agreed to supply the total amount of wheat reques he GDR . In all , three and a half million tons of grain are to be imp _ Russia during the four year period . Rau said that such shipments wi antee the supply of bread to the East German population even in case harvest in the GDR . Included among the grain shipments are feeds for stock . The imports of meat , fat , wool , flax , tobacco and tea will su dly cover an important part of GDR consumption . He pointed out the g ity of the USSR in selling tobacco and wool to the GDR , even though t is itself an importer of these items . The Soviet Union will deliver imports of cotton planned by the Five - Year Plan . Rau pointed out that such long - term trade agreements are only possibl ween countries whose economies are developed according to a long - term nomic plan . He gave several examples to prove the friendly cooperation ween these two countries , according to which either one of them is will change its production plans to help the other .

In reciprocation , the Soviet Union , which had n ned to export to the GDR any ferrous alloys , has now agreed to do so se of the requirements of the GDR for the large quantities of alloyed ■ ls which are to be produced . The Soviet Union has also agreed to ex 000 tana exually to the CDP Thi 0 He admitted that it had been necessary to limit exports of products synthetic gasolines produced by the Leuna and Boehlen Works since the acity in the GDR will not be sufficient to fulfil requirements during t few years , He also admitted that it had not been possible for the G ply many of the machines requested by the USSR . Rau Bays that the USS er satellite countries are making such demands for ships that the ship t be more rapidly expanded than was planned in the Five - Year Plan . He efly discussed the technical cooperation agreement which was signed at to cover one - half of importation requirements . The quantities of non- rous metals to be imported under the agreement are also said to cover a ge portion of GDR requirements and importation of alloyed metals is to be ered completely by the Soviet Union . This is said to be the first time that the Soviet Union has agreed to ● rt machines to the GDR . These are said to be machines which are not manu tured in the GDR and which were formerly imported from West Germany . Rau claimed that similarly to the first and second quarters the GDR pro- tion plan for the third quarter of 1951 was also overfulfilled despite the plete lapse of interzonal trade . The exportation from the GDR to the USSR of food processing equipment alls that early this year Rau complained about the unnecessary production d processing equipment in the GDR . In discussing this exportation , Rau me med that the delegation which went to Russia visited a meat processing fac y in Moscow which covers the consumption requirements of the eight million abitants of Moscow with 1,000 tons of meat and sausage daily . He admitted that it had been necessary to limit exports of products such synthetic gasolines produced by the Leuna and Boehlen Works since the acity in the GDR will not be sufficient to fulfil requirements during the t few years , He also admitted that it had not been possible for the GDR t ply many of the machines requested by the USSR . Rau Bays that the USSR an er satellite countries are making such demands for ships that the shipyard . t be more rapidly expanded than was planned in the Five - Year Plan . He als efly discussed the technical cooperation agreement which was signed at the e time . In an editorial comment on Heinrich Rau\\'s press conference in the gliche Rundschau ( October 16 , 1951 ) it is claimed that the trade agreement based on world market prices but these prices will be set up as average rly prices so as to prevent speculative variations . It was also claimed t the USSR has , during this year , exported raw materials to the GDR at the prices because the prices of finished goods exported by the GDR have not The manganese and chrome ore deliveries are said to equal those reques the GDR . Enough iron ore is to be delivered to the Huettenkombinat - Ost mit them to increase the production of pig iron planned for the year 195 m 500,000 tons to 900,000 tons.1 / Russian pig iron shipments are said t er the principal part of the GDR importation requirements and rolled prod to cover one - half of importation requirements . The quantities of non- rous metals to be imported under the agreement are also said to cover a ge portion of GDR requirements and importation of alloyed metals is to b ered completely by the Soviet Union . The exportation from the GDR to the USSR of food processing equipme alls that early this year Rau complained about the unnecessary produc i processing equipment in the GDR . In discussing this exportation , F ned that the delegation which went to Russia visited a meat processin ✓ in Moscow which covers the consumption requirements of the eight mi abitants of Moscow with 1,000 tons of meat and sausage daily . In an editorial comment on Heinrich Rau\\'s press conference in the -liche Rundschau ( October 16 , 1951 ) it is claimed that the trade agre ased on world market prices but these prices will be set up as avera ly prices so as to prevent speculative variations . It was also olai ; the USSR has , during this year , exported raw materials to the GDR = prices because the prices of finished goods exported by the GDR have n as fast as the world prices of raw materials . \" This means a presen GDR of 100 million DM \" says the Taegliche Rundschau . The comment is that , in the GDR foreign trade plan , there are reserves for possibl the Chairman of the State Planning Commission , Heinrich Rau , gives expected , an incomplete picture of this agreement . Nevertheless , a certain amount of information which gives some insight into the of these long - term agreements and permits a few conclusions . The ortant aspects of the information given by Rau seem to be as follo The long - term trade agreements can be considered as frame agree- ments which establish annual quotas for certain important com- modities to be exchanged . Detailed specifications are pre- sumably negotiated annually and form part of the annual trade agr ment . As such , the long - term trade agreements are an amplifica- tion of the Soviet planning system or rather a method of extensid of unified planning over the entire orbit . It has all the char- acteristics of Soviet planning methods , particularly the concen- tration on key items and priorities . Rau\\'s statement does not reveal the inside story of the negotia- tions and emphasis is placed on the concessions and commitments obtained from the Soviet Union . It is nevertheless certain that some of these concessions and commitments are of considerable im- portance to the GDR economy . This again should not be interpre- ted as reflecting altruistic Russian motives but rather a more realistic and long - term realization of the economic potential of the GDR . The statement of Rau that the volume of the trade agreement was limited exclusively by the ability of the GDR to deliver , is of interest . Though not stated specifically , it is undoubtedly true that on a number of important items nearly the entire export potential of the GDR has been earmarked for exports to the Soviet Union . Since the trade agreement with Russia constitutes the first long - term agreement ( except for the insignificant agreement with Albania ) and the long - term agreements with the other satel- lites are to follow only after the firm commitments to the USSR were made , this indicates the preferential position of the Soviet in orbit economic integration . Several significant indications were given by Rau that the nego- tiations on the long - term trade agreement with Soviet Russia The long - term trade agreements can be considered as frame agre ments which establish annual quotas for certain important com modities to be exchanged .

Nevertheles : reveals a certain amount of information which gives some insight into th workings of these long - term agreements and permits a few conclusions . most important aspects of the information given by Rau seem to be as foll T specific purpose of the press conference by Rau should be viewed i ext of the East - West struggle in Germany . It combined lures and th German businessmen and West Germans in general and thus represents clumsy , but not necessarily unsuccessful , effort to make Eastern ion or \" neutrality \" more attractive to some West Germans . On the basis of this information , a preliminary view on the workings of orbit economie integration system can be ventured . The long - term agree s appear to extend beyond national bundaries the advantages as well as grievous shortcomings of the Soviet - type planned economy . The advantag ist basically in a greater degree of security for the minimum needs of omy ( e.g. supply of grains , coke , etc. ) . This , however , also implies of he great shortcomings of the system , namely its self - imposed limitation im generally only at the primary , most primitive , and minimum needs of omy . Furthermore , it can be expected that super - imposed on this basic ency will be all the inadequacies and failures of the system of quotas illment records , with its wasteful burocracy , its strange combination o lenecks and undisposable surpluses , only probably in a more aggravated f to their extension in space and over national boundaries .

Mr. Perrone came to my office this morning at his own request t inform the Department , on instructions from his Foreign Office , that it had learned from reliable sources that the Soviet Union had offer to enter into a commercial agreement with Tunisia . According to the same sources the Tunisian reaction was not to preclude entirely the P prospect of negotiating such an agreement . The Tunisian Government did , however , inform the Soviets that it wished first to complete it discussions with the U.S. Government on the subject of U.S. economic aid to Tunisia before considering the desirability of a commercial agreement with the Soviet Union- Abdallah Farhat , Director Prime Minister Cabinet , told m USSR some weeks ago inquired via Tunisian Embassy Paris whether GOT would sell Soviets 2000 tons olive oil for payment in US dollars .

It seems Commerce Department\\'s tance to request end use checks was at least partly based on London\\'s tch No. 1042 dated March 13 and our reply A - 362 of April 5.

Alloy steel containing certain proportions of molybdenum has the property of with- standing high temperatures and is therefore essential in the production of jet engines . About 90 % of the world\\'s production of molybdenum is mined in the United States and consequently has been in short supply within the Soviet bloc . For this reason molybdenum was placed on the U.S. 1A list November 29 , 1949 and negotiations were immediately begun to place it on International List I. The Coordinating Committee in Paris recommended molybdenum for List I on August 16th although this action has not yet been ratified by member governments . Norway , the only European producer , has been under considerable pressure by the Soviets to export the item . Molybdenum was included in the 1949 trade agreement with the USSR . No trade agreement was concluded for 1950. Presumably to avoid shipments to or pressure from the USSR there has been little production so far in 1950 . During February 1950 , Betterby Inc. of New York filed an application with the Department of Commerce for 100 tons of molybdenum to be consigned to Industrial Speciality Company , London . The license was issued without resort to an end use check although Betterby Inc. had apparently indicated that in the absence of a statement by the Industrial Speciality Company it was assumed that the material was for resale in the United Kingdom . In May , Betterby Inc. filed another application for 100 tons and a license was again issued by Commerce .

This is a function which is not now being performed and which , by its nature , has to be done in one place to be effective . We suggest , therefore , adding at the end of the first sentence in paragraph 2 , the following : \" directed to the exploration of all promising possibilities of action , the examination of combinations of various techniques and detailing of firm basis for formulation of policy decisions \" . In the next sentence , we suggest deleting the phrase \" consistent with basic agency responsibilities \" . 3.

Attempts to recover ships from the Chinese by resort to the courts of friendly countries indicate that little success could be expected . There is indication that the courts of most countries would disclaim jurisdiction on the basis that such courts are not competent to render judgment in a dispute between two foreign governments . There is also the claim of sovereign immunity which the Russians un- doubtedly would make . The probability of successful court action in specific countries can be determined only by exhaustive study of legal philosophy and precedents in those countries . The value of attempting by legal means to harrass the Russians in the use of the lend - lease ships is also doubtful . Such an attempt would involve political problems arising from using the courts of friendly countries for this purpose . 1.

As far as the Department is aware no significant quantities of strategic materials are moving into the Soviet bloc from the United States through either INTRAC or any similar expo import agencies .

As a result of these controls it is possible to say that , with the exception of illegal trans actions and of some transit movements originating abroad ind passing through American ports , no shipments which vere considered at the time to be of strategic importance to the Soviet Bloc have been allowed to go from the Uni tec States to those areas since early 194.

These controls also effectively prevent shipments to the Sovi Union and its satelliter of other important geods of strategic importance . Despite these controls over the more strategic Lypes of goods , it is true that there remains a margin of exports of lower strategic rating or of no strategic importance , which are exported to Exstern Europe in return for imports which are necessary to maintain eco- nomic strength in the west . Our studies indicate that the balance of advantage from this trade lies with the west , although it is always difficult to Judge which side gains the most from a trade deal which each party wishes to conclude . In connection with Mr. Kirkland\\'s question on trad between Latin American nations and the Soviet bloc , I might point out that in 1949 only slightly more than th percent or total Latin American exports went to those c associated areas . of the products sent , a very sizeabl percentage were goods that were distinctly of no stra- tegic importance and had not been able to rind markets elsewhere .

The export regulations of the United States would proh : rt of the equipment referred to in your letter and catal et Bloc countries . However , the decision of approval o the export from Italy of the furnaces described is withi sdiction of the Italian Government . Our company has for a great many years licensed a number of furnace producers in Europe which manufacture LECTROM - LT Arc Furnaces catalogue on which is enclosed . This furnace is utilized in steel foundries for production of shells and tank castings and in the large sizes in rolling mills for the production of ingot steel for rolling . Licenses are in effect with companies in England , Spain , France , Belgi and Italy . This company has no financial investment in the Furopean furnace building but acts more or less as a consulting engineer , recei an engineering fee for plans and services rendered . The first of thes agreements , which was with Spain , was made in the 20\\'s . - Mr. Robert Boutigny , chief engineer , for the Italian company is in this country . He tells me he found that their Genoa man had received an inquiry from the Russians for thirty furnaces ranging in size from 6 tons per heat which would indicate foundry furnaces , to 30 tons per heat which would indicate furnaces for making ingots for rolling , a total value of the equipments involved being about 3-1 / 2 million dollars . That their man in Genoa had made quotation to the Russians on the old type of furnaces that they had been building previous to taking up the manufacturing of the LECTROMELT design . Mr. Boutigny told him that the matter would have to be In 1949 the Italian builder advised that they had an inquiry from sia for 30 LECTROMELT furnaces for steel making . The matter was referred the department and advice had that there was no objection that the ision fell within the jurisdiction of the government of Italy . - in hat We are in a position to definitely prohibit the sale of our ■ sign equipment by the Italians to Russia .

( END UNCLASSIFIED ) ( BEGIN OFFICIAL USE ONLY ) According to the Trade Section of the Indonesian Foreign Office , this agreement is the result of the Indonesia – USSR trade protocol signed in 1961 covering 1962 commerci relations between the two countries . In the protocol , the Soviet Union contracted to buy specified quantities of Indonesian agri- cultural products in return for the Indonesian importation of Russian goods of approximately equal value ( see Emb . Despatch 737 , May 7 , 1962 ) . A Foreign Office official stated that , while the JSSR has fulfilled its end of the bargain , Indonesia has been unable to import the quantity of Soviet goods agreed to , with the exception of the cotton textiles , because of its acute shortage of Foreign exchange . The protocol reportedly mentions only volume of goods and commodities , leaving the purchase prices of all items to be determined by separate negotiations .

U ms of the protocol , however , Indonesia will receive a ar deferment of payments for the textile purchase . COMMENT : This type of hazy agreement has become creasingly common between the GOI and its trading rtners . The Soviet shipment constitutes approximat percent by value of Indonesia\\'s current annual tex port requirement . In line with past policy , the US expected to attempt to obtain a mortgage on future donesian exports as payment for the purchase .

A S C During June , 1952 , recorded remittances to China from residents of Malaya totalled M31.78 million , compared with a monthly average during the first six months of 1952 of M $ 2.3 million and a monthly average during 195 of nearly M3 million . Recorded remittances during the first six months of 1952 are estimated at M13.8 million . The decline in remittances to China can be attributed primarily to the fall in income in Malaya as a result of xports to China and the Soviet bloc are rigidly controlled , and there have een no attempts on the part of the Soviet bloc to expand their export rade to Malaya . Although there have been rumblings of discontent among ome rubber traders ( principally Chinese ) over the policy of not selling ubber to China , as a result of the presently depressed price of rubber nd discontent with the rubber buying policy of the United States , such eelings have not developed to significant proportions , and it does not ap- ear likely , in the absence of further precipitous declines in rubber prices hat they will do so . There is evidence that a substantial quantity of ubber is stolen by Malayan Communist guerillas from rubber estates , and sol o obtain funds to support their operations , but the rubber so stolen is sol the Singapore market , and it is not believed that any of it is ultimately iverted to other than commercial channels . ould decrease as loopholes in Malayan export controls are tightened and c ms control becomes more efficient .

The people who were on this land before its development practically were nomads % ; B and the sinking of the wells made water available for the establishment of villages . This family wisely furnished water to the villages and small irrigable plots to the villagers , who furnished the labor for the commercial crops . Out of this developed a relationship between the family and the local population which I believe is unique . With the redistribution of land and other measures adverse to the old land- owning class , the majority of the members of this class have left the land , many of them leaving the country . Other members of this family have left the country . This man , although dispossessed except for the small maximum acreage allowed to one individual , has stayed with the land and his villagers , I believe more for their sakes than for his own . I am told that , despite the redistribution among the villagers , the operation of the lands in question continues relatively undisturbed , my friend supervising their work for their com accounts in almost the same way that he supervised it when it was for his account . He is so much beloved that , despite his being a Copt , a Christian , and a former landlord , the Egyptian officialdom treats him with respectful attention and has had him serve on the Commission administering the redistribution of land . He is received with consideration and respect in the ministries and government offices in Cairo ; al- though they must know that he does not approve of many of the things that are going on . The reason for our people\\'s intimacy with him is close personal friendship and the fact that he has served our Egyptian Company for many years as a very active Director . He and Davis , our Manager , are due to arrive in New York within about a week and will pay us a visit here . I am sure Dave plans to come to see you . I am wondering whether you would like for my friend to do so also . If so , we might want to handle it discreetly , lest he suffer embarrassment when he returns home .

E MESSAGE CENTER JUN 21 1957 TO THE RM / R CENTRAL FILES CONTROL 52 A CENTER TO THE THE RM / R CENTRAL FILES Since our last meeting in Egypt , events have been moving very fast . While e major political issues are being debated on a higher level , there are many forms taking place internally that many people are not aware of . Russian pro nda , via the cinema , the Press , and Radio broadcasts are being carried out . udents are being given scholarships . Russian goods are being dumped in the yptian market , especially agricultural machinery . Many commercial representa ves from China , Czechoslovakia , Poland , and other Eastern countries are encou make personal contacts with the Egyptians so as to increase the ties of comm al and friendly relations . I firmly believe that it is to the interest of ypt and our two countries to increase cultural , commercial , and friendly rela ons between our two peoples and I fear this angle is being neglected and if thing is done now to amend this , it may be too late at any other time .

The resulting ice would make American books more than three times their cost , if computed at Ficial values . Mr. Attala inquired whether under these circumstances there was not some possi- ity of using the procedures of \" Informational Media Guaranties . \" However , since ere has been no procurement under the United States - Egyptian Informational Guaranty Ogram since its inception , May 3-7 , 1955 , Mr. Attala was advised that this possi- Eity would be explored .

Nevertheless , during that period exports to the Free ld were actually larger than during the current year , and the o - Soviet Bloc share did not exceed 50 percent of the total . Traditionally major buyers of Egyptian cotton , such as France , the ted Kingdom , Italy , West Germany , Switzerland , India , and Japan , have general sharply reduced their purchases of Egyptian cotton over the t two years . So far as the current year is concerned this decline is tly explained by the strong stock position of some textile manufacturers , eciall in Western Europe , and partly because some manufacturers have and it possible to shift to less expensive American or American - type ton . Bloc resales of Egyptian cotton to Western Europe do not seen to a major factor . Sales of American cotton under HL 480 to India and some tern European countries , however , apparently have encouraged smaller chases from Egypt .

It is eresting to note that with the decline in Egypt\\'s cotton exports to t Free World countries the United States , next to Japan , has become the t important importer of Egyptian cotton outside of the Bloc .

Traditionally major buyers of Egyptian cotton , such as France , the United Kingdom , Italy , West Germany , Switzerland , India , and Japan , have in general sharply reduced their purchases of Egyptian cotton over the past two years . So far as the current year is concerned this decline is partly explained by the strong stock position of some textile manufacturers , especiall in Western Europe , and partly because some manufacturers have found it possible to shift to less expensive American or American - type cotton . Bloc resales of Egyptian cotton to Western Europe do not seem to be a major factor . Sales of American cotton under HL 480 to India and some Western European countries , however , apparently have encouraged smaller purchases from Egypt . Political factors growing out of the Suez crisis have specifically limited exports to France and the United Kingdom .

It is interesting to note that with the decline in Egypt\\'s cotton exports to most Free World countries the United States , next to Japan , has become the most important importer of Egyptian cotton outside of the Bloc . In rryover stocks , the quantity available for export during the ye proximated 325,000 metric tons . As noted above , exports up to ril 2 , 1958 amounted to only 138,000 tons , leaving a residue of ughly 185,000 tons to be exported during the next five months . further complicating factor is that from 40 to 50 percent of th portable cotton is probably extra long staple , for which Free W emand is relatively weaker at the present time . The Egyptian Government has recently endeavored to stimulate cot sales to the Free World through establishing a flexible export pound rate that amounts to a partial devaluation of the Egyptian pound . Unfortunately , this effort has not yet been rewarded with any major success . It seems likely that Egypt may be able to make some importa sales to India , and possibly to France and the United Kingdom , but la carryover stocks still seem likely unless the Bloc increases its rate of imports from Egypt . In view of this situation it is not unlikely that Egyptian cotton may come up for discussion during Nasir\\'s immine  Interestingly , a few days later ( September 21 ) , the Civil an ilitary Gazette of Lahore , in an exclusive story from its Londo orrespondent , H.K.

In the present context , the USSR is iously exploiting these and other recent statements in order to genera feeling toward the ECM and to further its own propaganda and economic etration efforts in Pakistan .

For sometime past the Embassy has been hearing reports to the effect at the procurement by the Ministry of Agriculture of about $ 2.5 million rth of Soviet - made draglines , bulldozers and graders in exchange for Greek bacco of equal value was encountering serious difficulties and might not go rough . In an effort to obtain reliable information about the present status - this transaction and , in the process , evaluate the possibilities that might ist for U. S. manufacturers to obtain at least a portion of the above business , Le Embassy discussed this matter with Mr. George Contogeorgis , Director of ports and Trade Agreements , Ministry of Commerce , and with Mr. John Paleologue , rector General of the Ministry of Agriculture in charge of the Ministry\\'s nd Development Service . The meeting with Mr. Contogeorgis took place on nuary 8 , 1961 , in the course of which he furnished the following information : 2. In August 1960 , the Russians agreed to purchase in Greece $ 2.5 million rth of 1959 crop tobacco , on condition that , in exchange , the Greek Government . uld purchase Soviet - made earthmoving machinery of equal value . The transaction s approved by the Foreign Trade Board and a resolution was passed in August 196 tting forth the details of the deal and the types of equipment to be purchased - the Greek Ministry of Agriculture . However , the resolution was not made blic until late in September 1960 ( see Embdes 427 , November 15 , 1960 ) . The ansaction was contingent on a clear understanding that the amount of tobacco I be purchased would be within the limits , and not in excess , of the amount of bacco that the Russians might eventually agree to buy from Greece during the lendar year 1961. The quota for CY 1960 was 8,000 tons and Mr. Contogeorgis ought that a similar quota for 1961 would probably be established when a new creement would be negotiated . It was also agreed that tobacco purchases under e proposed arrangement would be confined to merchandise which the Greek -vernment had bought and had been holding in stock in connection with the plementation of its 1959 tobacco price support program . Cote 3. The Russians were given samples and prices of the various Government- ld lots of 1959 crop tobacco and after a while reported to the Ministry of mmerce that the quotations were too high and the grades offered did not rictly meet their requirements JEnepekides / RD / ce REPORTER ADTATT se 122 91 OFFICIAL USE ONLY FEB 9 19 FILE LWS 7. In this connection Mr. Contogeorgis expressed the personal view tha the above - mentioned transaction and any additional sales of tobacco to the I which might materialize in the near future , should not preclude the sale of some U.S. equipment to the Ministry of Agriculture under the recently revise utilization requirements for Defense Support dollar funds . He suggested the this possibility be brought to the attention of the appropriate officials of Ministry of Agriculture and urged strongly that agricultural and road - buildi equipment be included in the list of potential imports from the U.S. to be financed with Defense Support funds . out the Russians were still unwilling to do business . The possibility that à further paring of prices on Government held stocks might react adversely on open - market U.S. and West German tobacco purchases , stopped Commerce Minister Dertilis from yielding further to the Soviet bargaining tactics and it was in that connection that rumors were spread that the entire deal had fallen through . 5. Early in January 1961 , the Russians came back indicating that they woul be prepared to buy one 450 - ton lot of Western Macedonia tobacco valued at about $ 500,000 , if the Greek Government would make a slight ( on the average 1 % ) reduction in price . The Minister of Commerce again refused to move on the ssumption that , if the Russians were genuinely interested in the transaction they would in the end pay the small difference in the price of the tobacco . 6. On January 11 , 1960 , Mr. Contogeorgis informed the Embassy by telephone chat , as anticipated , the Russians had finally decided to accept the Greek Government\\'s quotation on the 450 - ton lot and that the transaction could now be considered as closed . Mr. Contogeorgis added that he had reasons to believe that the Russians might purchase additional quantities possibly as much as nother 500-600 tons thus providing the basis for the procurement by the Ministry of Agriculture of at least $ 1.5 million worth of Soviet - made equipment gainst the original FTB approval for $ 2.5 million . -- 7. In this connection Mr. Contogeorgis expressed the personal view that the above - mentioned transaction and any additional sales of tobacco to the USSR which might materialize in the near future , should not preclude the sale of some U.S. equipment to the Ministry of Agriculture under the recently revised utilization requirements for Defense Support dollar funds . He suggested that this possibility be brought to the attention of the appropriate officials of the Ministry of Agriculture and urged strongly that agricultural and road - building equipment be included in the list of potential imports from the U.S. to be Financed with Defense Support funds . 8. On January 11 , 1961 , the question of the requirements of the Ministry of Agriculture for mechanical equipment was reviewed with the Ministry\\'s Director General , Mr. John Paleologue , in the course of a meeting with Embassy representat Ar . Paleologue indicated that his long experience and intimate familiarity with nechanical equipment owned and operated by the Ministry of Agriculture had convinced him of the unquestionable superiority of U.S. well - drilling , agricultu and earthmoving equipment , which he described as the best in the world . He described the Russian crawler Y tractors as being equipped with Colerably good power plants but he considered their track system not sturdy enough for Greek operating conditions . He said the blades of Russian - made \" 6. On January 11 , 1960 , Mr. Contogeorgis informed the Embassy by telephor that , as anticipated , the Russians had finally decided to accept the Greek Government\\'s quotation on the 450 - ton lot and that the transaction could now be considered as closed . Mr. Contogeorgis added that he had reasons to believe that the Russians might purchase additional quantities possibly as much as another 500-600 tons thus providing the basis for the procurement by the Ministry of Agriculture of at least $ 1.5 million worth of Soviet - made equipment against the original FTB approval for $ 2.5 million . - 4. In a desire to clinch the deal , the Ministry of Commerce agreed , in mid - December , to shave quotations down to the lowest prices currently being paid for the same or similar grades of tobacco by West German and U.S. buyers , but the Russians were still unwilling to do business . The possibility that a further paring of prices on Government held stocks might react adversely on open - market U.S. and West German tobacco purchases , stopped Commerce Minister Dertilis from yielding further to the Soviet bargaining tactics and it was in that connection that rumors were spread that the entire deal had fallen through 8. On January 11 , 1961 , the question of the requirements of the Minist griculture for mechanical equipment was reviewed with the Ministry\\'s Dir ral , Mr. John Paleologue , in the course of a meeting with Embassy represe Paleologue indicated that his long experience and intimate familiarity v nical equipment owned and operated by the Ministry of Agriculture had _nced him of the unquestionable superiority of U.S. well - drilling , agric earthmoving equipment , which he described as the best in the world . He ribed the Russian crawler Y tractors as being equipped with • ably good power plants but he considered their track system not sturdy gh for Greek operating conditions . He said the blades of Russian - made lozers have been found to be weak and unable to withstand the extra stra ed on them by Greece\\'s hard and rocky soil . However , the Russians sed to equip the bulldozers to be purchased by Greece with reinforced es and tracks ... Mr. Paleologue indicated that the technical specificat not yet been finalized and were still subject to approval by the Ministr 5. Early in January 1961 , the Russians came back indicating that they epared to buy one 450 - ton lot of Western Macedonia tobacco valued at ab 000 , if the Greek Government would make a slight ( on the average 11 % ) tion in price . The Minister of Commerce again refused to move on the ption that , if the Russians were genuinely interested in the transactio would in the end pay the small difference in the price of the tobacco . 11 . Mr. Paleologue heard with genuine interest the possibility of shift at least a portion of the Ministry\\'s requirements for earthmoving equipment from the USSR to the United States and eagerly sought information as to how this could be done . He was told about the recent Presidential directive limiting the use of Defense Support grant aid funds to the procurement of Ame : products only and the efforts being made by USOM / G and the Embassy to have fal and roadbuilding machinery included in a tentative list of commodities procurable from the United States against the amount of $ 11 million in 1960/6 Defense Support funds still available ( see Embdes 576 , January 9 , 1960 , item 10. On the principle that Russian equipment was better than no equipme at all , the Ministry of Agriculture , according to Mr. Paleologue , reluctantl agreed to the purchase of Soviet equipment and in May 1960 gave its consent to the procurement of 15 track - laying draglines , 100 bulldozers and 15 grade of a total estimated delivered value of $ 2,574,700 , on the basis of which th Foreign Trade Board issued its August 1960 approval . There had been some d in concluding the transaction and , at the time of the meeting , Mr. Paleologu was not in a position to say whether and to what extent the proposed purchas would actually be made . 9. Mr. Paleologue added that for several years past he had been trying Obtain approval for the purchase of U.S. tractors , bulldozers and other es of earthmoving equipment for the requirements of the Land Development vice of the Ministry of Agriculture , but his plans had been frustrated by la funds . Early in 1960 his attention was called to the possibility of procuri ⇒ such equipment from the USSR in exchange for Greek tobacco . It was nted out to him that , inasmuch as the Greek farmers had already been paid the Greek Government for the tobacco that would be sold to the Russians , the ernment could afford to spread amortization of the drachma value of the ipment to be imported from Russia over a period of years during which part the amount advanced would be earned from renting out the equipment to farm Deratives and part of it would be set off against budgetary appropriations the implementation of the Government\\'s land development program . 10 . On the principle that Russian equipment was better than no equipment all , the Ministry of Agriculture , according to Mr. Paleologue , reluctantly ed to the purchase of Soviet equipment and in May 1960 gave its consent the procurement of 15 track - laying draglines , 100 bulldozers and 15 graders a total estimated delivered value of $ 2,574,700 , on the basis of which the eign Trade Board issued its August 1960 approval .

Therefore , if , say $ 1,000,000 worth U.S. ipment were to be procured under the recent utilization procedures for ense Support funds , the Ministry of Agriculture must find 30 million drachm purchase the necessary foreign exchange and then repay the loan out of its -1 and subsequent budgetary allocations over a period of several vears . 13. Mr. Paleologue said that a financing arrangement of this charact extended beyond his own jurisdiction and competence , but he indicated that he would discuss the matter with his Minister and urge that the possibilit of buying some U. S. equipment be fully explored . He thought that as long the purchase of Soviet equipment of doubtful reliability seemed inevitable it would be highly desirable for his Service to be given an opportunity to acquire some U. S. equipment of proven durability in order ( a ) to bring ou emphatically the comparative worth of the two types of equipment , and ( b ) insure uninterrupted work on construction projects in progress in the even some of the Soviet equipment should break down . Since this despatch has been typed , the Embassy has received information to the effect that the Russian bought another 300 tons of Government - owne 1959 crop tobacco worth about $ 200,000 . Accordingly , as of January 19 , total purchases by the USSR of 1959 crop tobacco amounted to 760 tons valued at approximately $ 700,000 against which the Greek Government is obligated to purchase Soviet roadbuilding and agricultural machinery . In the past few days there has been such an active demand from other sources for Government - held 1959 tobacco that Ministry of Commerce offici doubt whether the Russians will be able to buy much more tobacco ɗ this category in implementation of their machinery barter agreement with the 2 .

In the course of the meeting , Mr. Komitsas made some interesti mments on recent developments in Greek - Soviet trade relations . 2. Mr. Komitsas stated that no definite date had yet been set for e visit to Moscow . About a week ago the Greek Government had asked the viet Government to suggest a suitable date , but so far no reply had en received . Originally , the Greek team was to be led by A. Triantafyllis , Director General of the Ministry of Commerce , t Mr. Triantafyllis asked to be relieved for poor health . The agreement gotiated in 1957 was for a three - year period with the understanding at the commodity lists on both sides would be revised on a year - to - year sis . The 1958/60 agreement expired on December 31 , 1960 but was not newed because the Greek trade delegation was prevented from going to SCOW . As a result , during the 1961 interim period trade was conducted re or less on the basis of the 1960 commodity lists . 3. On the basis of the 1960 commodity lists , the volume of Greek ports to the Soviet Union was estimated at between $ 22 and $ 23 million , ile Soviet exports to Greece were projected at between $ 24 and $ 25 llion . Mr. Komitsas explained that the reason the import list in 1960 av 4. The principal Soviet products imported by Greece ( with c.i.f. value figures in parentheses ) were : crude oil for the Aspropyrgos refinery ( $ 7.5 million ) ; processed petroleum products ( mainly diesel and fuel oil , $ 6.7 million ) ; lumber ( $ 6.8 million ) . The difference of approximately $ 7 million was made up of iron and steel products ( $ 970,000 ) , machinery ( $ 739,000 ) and a variety of other items , such as canned fish , chemical products , paper and allied products , motion pictures , etc. Petroleum products , it will be noted , accounted for fully 50 % of Greek imports from the USSR with lumber ranking second with approximately 25 % of the total . higher in value than the export list by about $ 2 million was that on ember 31 , 1959 the Greek - Soviet clearing account reflected a credit balan favor of Greece ( i.e. excess of Greek exports and services to the USSR r Greek imports and services from the USSR ) of $ 2.1 million , which the Gr ernment was anxious to liquidate . As it turned out , actual trade between two countries during the calendar year 1960 ( in round figures on nsactions basis , i.e. actual clearances through customs ) , developed along -reciably different lines as follows : 5. The principal Greek exports to the USSR in 1960 ( with f.o.b. va parentheses ) were : leaf tobacco ( $ 8.7 million ) ; B seedless raisins ( su 9 million ) ; bauxite ( $ 2.2 million ) ; raw cotton ( $ 1.3 million ) , and c it ( oranges and lemons , $ 1.8 million ) . The balance of about $ 2 millio e up mainly of raw skins , sponges and black olives in brine . Gree vernment was anxious to liquidate . As it turned out , actual trade between e two countries during the calendar year 1960 ( in round figures on ansactions basis , i.e. actual clearances through customs ) , developed along preciably different lines as follows : Greek commodity imports from the USSR ( c.i.f. basis ) Greek commodity exports to the USSR ( f.o.b. basis ) Greek trade deficit $ 28.3 million $ 18.8 million $ 9.5 million === 4. The principal Soviet products imported by Greece ( with c.i.f. value gures in parentheses ) were : crude oil for the Aspropyrgos refinery ( $ 7.5 Ilion ) ; processed petroleum products ( mainly diesel and fuel oil , $ 6.7 llion ) ; lumber ( $ 6.8 million ) . The difference of approximately $ 7 million s made up of iron and steel products ( $ 970,000 ) , machinery ( $ 739,000 ) and a riety of other items , such as canned fish , chemical products , paper and lied products , motion pictures , etc. Petroleum products , it will be noted , 8. Turning to the immediate purpose of his call , Mr. Komitsas explained t in the 1958/60 three - year trade agreement , the export quota for Greek ve oil was 2,000 tons annually or 6,000 tons for the entire three - year iod . However , largely because of short 1959 and 1960 olive oil crops , actu orts amounted to 1,000 tons in 1958 and 110 tons in 1960 making a total of 10 tons . In view of this year\\'s bumper olive oil production ( estimated about 200,000 tons ) and the prospective large export surplus ( domestic sumer requirements are estimated at between 125,000 and 130,000 tons ually ) , the Greek Government is anxious to negotiate the inclusion of a 00 - ton olive oil quota in the 1962 export commodity list and 2,000 tons for n of the following two years , or a total of 8,000 tons for the proposed ee - year ( 1962/64 ) trade agreement with the USSR . Mr. Komitsas was not sure ther the Russians would agree to the proposed increase ; nevertheless the ek Government wished to aim at a 4,000 - ton quota for 1962 in order to eviate the mounting pressure on the Government from Greek olive oil produce assistance in averting a further decline in olive oil prices . He pointed that the Greek Government was planning to engage in large - scale olive oil ce - support buying and storage ( present plans are for the purchase of at st 30,000 tons ) , but even such buying would take off the market no more tha ut 50 % of the estimated surplus . He also stressed the fact that for the t several years the Greek Ministry of Agriculture has pursued a policy of anding olive oil production by encouraging Greek farmers to plant and graft Mr. Komitsas reported that the cumulative payments deficit under the ateral Greek - Soviet clearing account as of October 31 , 1961 , was about $ 7.8 lion . Obviously this figure makes allowances for earlier ( pre - 1960 ) credit ances in the clearing account and for current invisible receipts and ments . 8. Turning to the immediate purpose of his call , Mr. Komitsas explained t in the 1958/60 three - year trade agreement , the export quota for Greek ve oil was 2,000 tons annually or 6,000 tons for the entire three - year iod . However , largely because of short 1959 and 1960 olive oil crops , actu orts amounted to 1,000 tons in 1958 and 110 tons in 1960 making a total of 10 tons . In view of this year\\'s bumper olive oil production ( estimated about 200,000 tons ) and the prospective large export surplus ( domestic sumer requirements are estimated at between 125,000 and 130,000 tons ally ) , the Greek Government is anxious to negotiate the inclusion of a 00 - ton olive oil quota in the 1962 export commodity list and 2,000 tons for a of the following two years , or a total of 8,000 tons for the proposed ee - year ( 1962/64 ) trade agreement with the USSR . Mr. Komitsas was not sure ther the Russians would agree to the proposed increase ; nevertheless the 000 9. Looking at the world olive oil supply - demand picture , Mr. Komita served that total olive oil consumption in non - producing countries was rrently at the rate of about 120,000 tons annually , compared to a prewar nsumption of approximately 180,000 tons . He noted that this sharp decli consumption was due to the heavy inroads that seed oils had made into rket for vegetable fats since World War II . He added that as long as mo n - producing countries use olive oil almost exclusively for salad dressin ther than for cooking , as is the case with producing countries , the like od of an appreciable increase in world consumption of olive oil in the ne ther the Russ . agree to the proposed increase ; nevertheless 034 reek Government wished to aim at a 4,000 - ton quota for 1962 in order to lleviate the mounting pressure on the Government from Greek olive oil prod or assistance in averting a further decline in olive oil prices . He point ut that the Greek Government was planning to engage in large - scale olive o rice - support buying and storage ( present plans are for the purchase of at east 30,000 tons ) , but even such buying would take off the market no more bout 50 % of the estimated surplus . He also stressed the fact that for the ast several years the Greek Ministry of Agriculture has pursued a policy o xpanding olive oil production by encouraging Greek farmers to plant and gr ore olive trees and , therefore , in the years ahead , the impact of the cycl hort - crop years on the olive oil supply situation should tend to be less 10. For all of these stated reasons , Mr. Komitsas said that the Greel Government was anxious to explore the possibilities of increasing Greek expo of olive oil to the Soviet Union but before doing so it wished to have the U.S. Government\\'s views on the matter . He stressed the fact that under bilateral trade agreements , quotas are permissive , rather than mandatory , in the sense that they are designed to establish maximım limits within which export licenses may be issued by the Bank of Greece . Therefore , even if the Russians agreed to raise the quota for 1962 to 4,000 tons , this would provid no assurance that they would buy that much oil from Greece . FS - 439 a OFFICIAL USE ONLY Encl .

For all of these stated reasons , Mr. Komitsas said that the Greek vernment was anxious to explore the possibilities of increasing Greek export olive oil to the Soviet Union but before doing so it wished to have the S. Government\\'s views on the matter . He stressed the fact that under lateral trade agreements , quotas are permissive , rather than mandatory , in e sense that they are designed to establish maximum limits within which port licenses may be issued by the Bank of Greece . Therefore , even if the ssians agreed to raise the quota for 1962 to 4,000 tons , this would provide assurance that they would buy that much oil from Greece . 11. The Economic Counselor made , in substance , the following statement : termination of the size of the quotas for olive oil and other Greek export oducts to be included in the Greek - Soviet trade agreement is essentially a eek Government responsibility in which the United States Government would rmally have no direct concern , beyond the role it might play in such rcumstances as \" friendly counselor \" . The United States from time to time s been required to concern itself with the export quotas for certain Greek oducts in trade agreements with unfriendly countries , in those cases wherein eece was contemplated to receive the same or similar agricultural products Her a PL - 480 Title I sales agreement . In the case of olive oil , this estion has arisen in connection with the procurement under PL - 480 of edible ed oil and / or oilseeds for local processing . It was on this basis that OM / G had taken exception to Greece\\'s olive oil export program for 1959/60 . asmuch as the current PL - 480 agreement ( signed in October 1961 ) does not clude any seed oil or oilseeds , and since operations under the earlier reement involving seed oil have , to all intends and purposes , been terminate e United States Government has no current interest in the matter which would quire it to take official note or to be concerned with the anticipated ncreased availabilities \" to the Soviet Union . 12. The Economic Counselor went on to say that he shares the concern cently expressed by the Minister of Commerce regarding the growing tendency bilateralism in the marketing of certain Greek export products for which appears difficult , under present conditions , to find outlets in the countri Western Europe . He appreciated that the Greek Government was also fully are of the hazards of becoming too deeply involved in bilateral trade with e USSR and its satellites , and that it recognized the dangerous potential verage which these countries might thereby gain in upsetting Greek economic uilibrium , were they ever permitted to become primary consumer markets for ch sensitive Greek products as tobacco , olive oil and citrus fruit . The onomic Counselor stressed the need of adapting the quality and packing of eek export products to the requirements of the Western European markets as means of lessening dependence on the markets of the Soviet bloc . 12 .

He pointed out that Greece could not afford to be in and out the world olive oil market without severe damage to her reputation as a liable source of supply of olive oil . He referred to 1960/61 as a year in ich Greece not only had no olive oil to export but was forced to import bstantial quantities of Spanish and North African oil in order to meet domes quirements . With this in mind , Greece should give serious consideration to e possibility of storing some of its periodic olive oil surpluses in order t able to maintain a steady flow of exports and , at the same time , to obviate e need for imports to cover domestic requirements . The Economic Counselor dicated that he would not wish to enter into a discussion of the adequacy of e available storage and handling facilities and of the problem of financing 15. On the general subject of exports to the Soviet bloc , Mr. Komits observed that , in his opinion , it would be wrong to hold bilateralism per s as solely responsible for the growth of Greek trade with the Soviet bloc in recent years . It was his view that bilateral trade agreements , with their controlled quotas , provided a more effective safeguard against an inordinat or undesirable expansion of trade in a given direction than might be the cas politically motivated free exchange trading . In this connection , the Greek Government recently took a notable step in trade liberalization by eliminat all licensing controls designed to boost Greek imports from bilateral tradi 13. With specific reference to olive oil exports , the Economic ounselor called attention to the fact that , if Greece wished to preserve ts position as one of the world\\'s principal sources of high quality edible live oil and was interested in maintaining a steady flow of exports , it sho ry to level out the peaks and troughs of the biennial olive oil production ycle by stockpiling enough oil in high crop years to offset the inevitable portages of the low crop years in which , normally , Greece would not have an xport surplus . He pointed out that Greece could not afford to be in and ou f the world olive oil market without severe damage to her reputation as a eliable source of supply of olive oil . He referred to 1960/61 as a year in 14. Mr. Komitsas declared that the question of keeping up olive oil xports in low and high - crop years alike has long been a preoccupation of the reek Government . His own proposal at a recent meeting on the subject was th he Greek Government ought to find some way of asserting its policy of free xports , regardless of the domestic supply situation . The simplest way to ccomplish this would be by eliminating altogether or reducing the import dut n olive oil to a nominal level in order to place domestic olive oil prices world competitive basis , and at the same time permitting unrestricted impor nd exports as might be determined by the free interplay of supply - demand cor itions at home and abroad . Another less satisfactory and possibly more xpensive way of achieving the same purpose would be for the Government to st ile olive oil in high - crop years making it available for distribution 18. Until a year or so ago , leaf tobacco was perhaps the principal ex ] commodity posing serious marketing problems , mainly because of the large quantities of old - crop tobacco accumulated in the hands of the Government as result of extensive price - support buying in the preceding five years . Since 1960 the tobacco situation has eased materially , however , and over the next years Greece not only does not envisage any stockpiling of surpluses but may be short of merchandable tobacco to meet normal export requirements . Accord to all intends and purposes , tobacco has ceased to be one of the sensitive products for which Greece has had to look to the East for marginal outlets . 16. The foregoing conversation with Mr. Komitsas brought into Sharper cus some of the problems facing the Greek Government in the development of eek exports in general , and more particularly in the matter of its trade lations with the Soviet bloc . In the first place there would seem to be r estion that the Greek Government , as a whole , is conscious of the pitfalls oby traps of trading with the Soviet bloc and is prepared to watch its ste the same time , however , there is undoubtedly a widespread feeling , within d without the Government , that Greece cannot afford to ignore the export ssibilities offered by the Eastern bloc for certain Greek products ( partic rly tobacco , sultanas , citrus fruit and bauxite ) and should take no action at might tend to reduce appreciably the present volume of trade . As the r nister of Commerce , Mr. Pipinelis , expressed it in a recent conversation w e Economic Counselor , the Greek Government looks upon trade with the Easte oc as a \" safety valve \" to let off steam when pressures on the domestic mar result + of mounting stocks of unsola export commoditie ain to mount untries . Mr. Komitsas cited as a case in point the setting aside of Ca solution 163 of 1958 which provided discretionary authority for the Min Commerce to accord preferential treatment to the products of Greece\\'s lateral trading partners in state or quasi - state procurement tenders . tion , Mr. Komitsas observed , removed the main policy objection to bilat ading arrangements . He added that elimination of the preferential trea imports from the Soviet bloc in the matter of deferred payment terms h moved another complaint of discrimination against the West . Mr. Komits . so thought that , if subversion through economic penetration were an obj Soviet policy in trading with Greece , nothing would prevent the Russia om accomplishing the same result by paying for their purchases in free 21 . The USSR has been a primary market for Greek bauxite , taking roug 50,000 tons of ore every year . There is a good possibility that , when the echiney - Reynolds - Niarchos aluminum plant begins to function , it will be abl o use a substantial portion of the bauxite now being mined for export to th SSR , thereby reducing Greece\\'s dependence on the Soviet market for this pro ntil that happens ( and it may take several years ) , Greek mine operators may e expected to continue looking to Russia as a major outlet for their produc 20 .

Such istance might take the form either of technical and financial assistan ablishing the types of processing plants that are needed for making the ustry internationally competitive or , even better , of encouraging the ation of joint venture processing and marketing enterprises which would bine valuable business experience on both sides . The quality of the ra erial that Greece has to offer is excellent ; what is lacking is proper dling and processing facilities and an adequate marketing set - up geared consumer requirements of the growing markets of Western Europe . 19 . The marketing of citrus fruit does present a problem in that the -of - the - mill quality of Greek oranges and lemons is not marketable in at Western European markets . Therefore , Greek exporters would have to use dern sorting , grading and packing methods before they could hope to netrate these markets in competition with other better organized exporting intries , such as Israel , Italy and Spain .

The Soviet bloc has been an important outlet for Greek seedless isins , commonly referred to as \" sultanas \" . In a normal crop year , such as 59 , the Soviet bloc countries took about 40 % of total Greek exports of Itanas , with the USSR as the principal buyer . During the 1959/60 export ason , the USSR purchased about 17,000 tons out of total Sovbloc purchases o 0 tons , and of aggregate exports to all destinations of approximate ] O tons . Obviously , Greece can ill afford to lose such an important t for one of its main export commodities and , unless the Western ean countries can provide an enlarged market for Greek sultanas , the s may well be expected to try to maintain and expand their sales to plus of this commodity ( now about 50,000 tons ) in the markets of the We long as the temptation of accepting from the Soviet bloc countries high in world prices can be resisted . Recent developments have highlighted t reat to Greece\\'s hard - earned economic stability by the practice of some stern bloc countries ( and Yugoslavia ) to pay higher prices for Greek cot 1 then re - export it to Western Europe at lower than world prices , thereb priving Greece of vitally needed foreign exchange , and undermining the sition of Greek cotton in these markets ( see Embdes 258 , October 11 , 196 ere is therefore every reason to expect that the Greek Government will m in the Sovbloc and Yugoslav quotas for cotton at a reasonable level and Fuse to issue extra - quota licenses .

The Embassy encloses a translation of a notice which appeared in the January issue of the Bulletin Mensuel d\\'Information of the Moroccan Office of Control and of Export . This notice is directed to those who are interes in exporting to the Soviet Union and summarizes the current trade agreement and the required procedures . It also gives a list of the Russian agencies concerned with specific types of imports . In the last section there is a brief summary of trade relations betw occo and the Soviet Union for the years 1957 and 1958 which are report ed on statistics published by the Soviet Union . It is curious that in lishing these figures no reference was made to the fact that they do n respond to the official Moroccan statistics , which are as follows : cording to the Russian figures , there was a drop in the total value of trad om 24.5 million rubles in 1957 to 19.2 million in 1958 , which would mean a crease of 21 per cent . The Moroccan figures , on the other hand , account fo decrease in total trade of only 12.7 per cent . The Russian import figures how a decrease from 21.9 million rubles in 1957 to 6.7 million in 1958 , a rop of 70 per cent , while the Moroccan figures show a drop of only 23.5 per ent . The Russian export figures show an increase from 3.4 million rubles in 57 to 4.5 million in 1958 , an increase of 32 per cent , but the Moroccan atistics show merely a 5.8 per cent increase . Figures given on tonnages fo Decific items are equally at variance , making sit impossible to reach any cor usions as to the reasons for these discrepancies between Moroccan and Russi Jade statistics for the two Drocco and the Soviet Union for the years 1957 and 1958 which are reportedly ased on statistics published by the Soviet Union .

This 15 million increase over the 1962 estimate would be represented rimarily by oxygen converters , which are gradually to replace open- earth furnaces in Soviet steel - processing .

In the past it has be eported that the Soviets have offered the Afghans transit rights f mports at competitive rates and guaranteeing transit time would no e more than four to six weeks . Comparatively little use has been f the Soviet route except for exports going to the Bloc countries . ne reason for the non - use of this route has been the refusal of we rn insurance companies to insure shipments through the U.S.S.H. , a t has recently been confirmed that even Lloyds of London will not chinmente using this route e \\' A \\' C Depl .
